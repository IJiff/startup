## AWS Notes

-Server ip: 44.290.168.214

-Assigning an elastic IP address to a server instance allows you to keep the same IP address even when restarting the instance

-You can purchase a domain with your choice of TLD very easily in AWS, and then connect it to a server instance using the "Hosted zones" tab and choosing "Create record"

-Caddy is a web service that makes handling HTTP requests a lot easier. As long as you configure your caddy file with the domain of your website, it will automatically use HTTPS and listen for HTTP requests for you.
