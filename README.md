# Reaction Race

This application will be very simple. A dot on the screen will flash a certain color after a random amount of time, and you must select that color as fast as possible.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Reaction race is a super simple, super awesome game to play with your friends. There's a single icon on the screen that will flash a random color at random intervals, and you have to select which color it flashed as fast as you can. It then computes your average reaction time and saves it in the score leaderboard for everyone to see. Have fun trying to beat all your friends!

### Design

![Design image](startup_design.png)

There are 4 key parts of this design. First, there is the large center dot that will display the color for you to select. Second, there are the smaller dots that you click when the center dot changes to that color. Third, there is the profile icon in the top left that lets you change your display name or account. Fourth, there is the leaderboard icon in the top right that allows you to view global rankings.
